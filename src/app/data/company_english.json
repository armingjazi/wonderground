  "bio": "Roser Tutusaus and Tom Weksler founded <strong>WONDERGROUND</strong> in 2018 in Barcelona, defining themselves as artisans of action and expression. Their work uncovers the hidden stories within the body, posing universal questions about humanity and its nature. They explore themes such as love, community, companionship, ecology, wilderness, death, and revelation. Their performances are captivating and physically rich, shaped by constant aesthetic research. They create <strong>Kinetic Poems</strong> and <strong>Meditative Spectacles</strong> through an interdisciplinary language that merges Contemporary Dance, Acrobatics, Butoh, partnering, text, and ephemeral architectures. Their movement language is developed through <strong>Movement Archery</strong>, a practice that refines both their pedagogy and creative process. In 2022, they established <strong>The Island</strong>, their creative workspace in the forested outskirts of Barcelona. This peaceful haven serves as a space for practice, creation, and artistic exchange, where they also host workshops and laboratories. He developed <strong>Movement Archery</strong>, a pedagogical and creative practice that refines both technique and artistic exploration. Together, their movement language is an evolving dialogue between control and risk, structure and spontaneity."
