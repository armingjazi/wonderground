  "bio": "Founded in 2018 in Barcelona by Roser Tutusaus and Tom Weksler, WONDERGROUND is a platform for artistic research and creation. We craft Kinetic Poems and Meditative Spectacles, uncovering hidden stories within the body and posing universal questions about humanity and its nature.\nOur work explores themes such as the individual, community, love, ecology, wilderness, death, and revelation, shaping performances that are both captivating and physically rich.\nWe merge Contemporary Dance, Acrobatics, Butoh, partnering, text, and ephemeral architectures into a living interdisciplinary language.\nOur research is rooted in Movement Archery, a practice that refines sensitivity, perception, and technique, guiding both our pedagogy and creative process.\nIn 2022, we established The Island, our creative workspace in the forested outskirts of Barcelona. This is a space for practice, creation, and artistic exchange, where we also host workshops and laboratories."
