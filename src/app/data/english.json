    "concept": "After the Rain takes this natural phenomenon as a metaphor for the ephemeral. At the same time that Tom and Roser entered a studio together, Roser's father was diagnosed with a brain tumor. AFTER THE RAIN is the artistic work that has accompanied and moved through the process of her father's illness and passing. It holds the sensations and questions that arise—many of which are deeply tied to the very essence of living. And it does so by looking at nature as a reflection. Letting go of someone you love is a deeply personal experience, yet also a universal one. From this perspective, the piece explores beliefs about love, death, transformation, spirit, and transcendence, mirroring itself in the natural world and its processes.",

    "fullDesc": "In this new creation, Wonderground presents a dreamlike journey in which four performers—two women, one man, and a live musician—explore the tensions between the human instinct for connection and the forces that pull us, both literally and metaphorically. Through landscapes that oscillate between the real and the imaginary—an internal storm, a body defying gravity, and amountain that breaks and rebuilds itself—they create a choreography that reflects the fragility and resilience of our time. Somewhere between a poetic recital and a rock concert, MOMENTUM fuses movement, acrobatic dance, minimalism, and humor to imagine what our future could be.",

    "tagline": "What moves us in a world that seems to have lost its balance?",
    "concept": "There is a universal truth when one feels gravity and the weight of the body. It is one of the most primal human experiences of what it means to be in the world. If we add displacement, a multiplicity of questions begins to arise. Why do we move in one direction? What drives us? Where do we want to go? What do we expect to find? Are we going or returning? <br/>  <br/>In MOMENTUM, this displacement materializes through the use of various extreme actions as generators of dramatic choreography. Spinning, falling, dragging, climbing, suspending, or flying all have a very specific relationship with gravity when we consider their distance from the ground. <br/>  <br/> <strong> We place these actions within archetypal natural landscapes, which follow one another and intuitively reveal symbolic relationships—both of the soul's inner landscapes and of the forces that sometimes govern our relationships. </strong>",
    "aesthetics": "The soundscape is created from deconstructed natural sounds and live music. The musical staging ranges from a poetic recital to a rock concert with a computer, samplers, electric guitar, and electronic drums.The stage space will recreate natural landscapes in an alternative way through portable objects, lights, colors,perspectives, trajectories, dimensions, and spatial depths.The stage itself is an object that transforms as theperformance progresses, but it does evocatively, with aminimalism that seeks to awaken the imagination. <br/>  <br/><strong>MOMENTUM aims to be a dreamlike, minimalist, free,unconscious spectacle—somewhere between futuristicand mythological. At the same time, it wishes to lookwith humor at where we are and where we are going(or could go!). </strong>"

    "concept": "Walls are architectures with great socio-political content. But what they really hide is the image of who or what is on the other side. They create a physical and mental division between self and other, between us and them. <strong>It is tempting to wonder if on the other side there is someone just like us...</strong>",
    "aesthetics": "WALL & PEACE has the aesthetics of Film Noir and is handcrafted with portable light objects. The show can be performed on any wall in any town or city. It is inspired by the mystery and fantasy of bedtime stories. A play with shadows; with visible and invisible; with dreams and ghosts. An act of transformation.<strong> A unique show that seeks to convey the spectacular nature of intimacy. </strong>"
